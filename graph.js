// 1. Initialize your graph here.

// 2. Add edges to your graph below

// 3. Create a function that takes a graph, a from node and a to node, 
//    and print the shortest path between the two nodes.
const shortestPath = (graph, to, from) => {
    let sp = [];
    // write the functionality here. Remember to look at the documentation!


    // return the shortest path as an array
    return sp

// (4.) Modify above function to handle it, if a path doesn't exist.
